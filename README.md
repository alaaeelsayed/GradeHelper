# GradeHelper

A simple tool I created to help me grade CS I student assignments.

I didn't really make it planning on releasing it. It was just specifically made for me but it is easy to modify.
Create a template PDF with submittable forms, download the full list of assignments using moodle into a zip file.
Change the values in FieldName to whatever they are in your template PDF. Everything else is self explanatory.
